## To Create a Site

To use the utility, you would run the following command:

    splug@dev.ve.zyp.io:~$ sudo nginxmgr -c "www.example.com,example.com,*.example.com"
    Creating site: www.example.com
    [ Completed ] Site has been created
    Enabling site: www.example.com
    Testing nginx configuration: nginx.
    Restarting nginx: nginx.
    [ Completed ] This site has been enabled and nginx reloaded
    Thank you and have a nice day!

This would create a directory in `/var/www/www.example.com` (your site name is the first fqdn that you pass) and skeleton directories of `web` and `logs` within in. A template for nginx will also be placed within `/etc/nginx/sites-available` for your domain.

***Note:*** By default, sites that are newely created are automatically 

By default the listening IP address and port in `*:80`. You can change this by passing option `-i ip.ad.dr.ess`. 


## To Enable a Site

This utility will create a symbolic link from the `sites-available` dir to `sites-enabled`, run `configtest` on nginx, and restart nginx:

    splug@dev.ve.zyp.io:~$ sudo nginxmgr -e www.example.com
    Enabling site: www.example.com
    Testing nginx configuration: nginx.
    Restarting nginx: nginx.
    [ Completed ] This site has been enabled and nginx reloaded
    Thank you and have a nice day!

## To Disable a Site

This utility will delete the symbolic link from the `sites-enabled` dir, run `configtest` on nginx, and restart it:

    splug@dev.ve.zyp.io:~$ sudo nginxmgr -d www.example.com
    Restarting nginx: nginx.
    [ Done! ]
    Thank you and have a nice day!

## To Delete a Site

The `-D`, `--delete` switch will remove your domains configuration from nginx, restart if it is currently active, and move the directory  `/var/www/domain` to `/var/www/domain.old`

    splug@dev.ve.zyp.io:~$ sudo nginxmgr -D www.testing2.com
    The www directory for this site has been moved to: '/var/www//www.testing2.com.old'
    [ Done! ]
    Thank you and have a nice day!
